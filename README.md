# Arduino RPi Pico Simon games
Arduino based Simon clone (and other mini games) built for a Raspberry Pi Pico. 

Code forked and mostly based on the work done by [LenkaDesign](https://github.com/LenkaDesign/Arduino-Arcade-Lego-Games-Box), 
used on a DIY game box based on the project done by [DIY-Machines](https://github.com/DIY-Machines/SimonSays).

## Memory Game ("Simon-Says"-like)

The rules are well known and simple. The game shows you a sequence of notes/lights and you need to repeat it. Each time one more tone/light is added to the sequence. The longer you survive, the better your memory is.

## Reaction game (similar to Whack-a-Mole game)

You need to be fast enough to hit each button that lights up. The longer you play the faster the buttons are lighting up. This one is great for training reaction of kids and adults.

## Contest/Competition game (for 2-4 players)

You are given 5 rounds. Everyone has to hit his button really fast after the signal is given (Coin tune from Mario). Whoever hits the button first wins the round. The number of wins is calculated at the end of 5 rounds and the winner is announced.

## Melody Game (Push and Play free mode for toddlers and smaller ones)

This one is excellent for toddlers - it plays alternating tunes when you press and hold a button.
After initial testing with kids we realized that our smaller one who was 1 year old really wants to play but does not understand HOW. The rules of this games are - NO RULES. You can hit any button and it will be producing sounds.
